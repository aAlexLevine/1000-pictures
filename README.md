# 1000 pictures

Image gallery for viewing 1000 high resolution photographs in a performant, stylish and mobile friendly application.

Images are from the [Lorem Picsum API](https://picsum.photos/)
CSS Framework [Material UI](https://next.material-ui.com/)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

#### Testing

Unit testing is managed by Jest and React Testing Library

Testing for this application is motivated not by implementation details but how a user actually engages with the DOM.

See [this article](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/introducing-the-react-testing-library) by Kent C. Dodds for a good primer on the library and the thought process behind it.

## Getting Started

First,

```bash
npm install
```

then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
